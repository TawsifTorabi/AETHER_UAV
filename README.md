## üåç Background
Bangladesh has seen a sharp rise in fire-related incidents and natural disasters in recent years. Fire incidents increased by ~50% from 2015 to 2024, with thousands of lives and properties at risk. Rapid urbanization, industrial growth, and climate challenges like flooding underscore the urgent need for a cost-effective, real-time reconnaissance and emergency response system.

## üéØ Objectives
- Design and develop a modular UAV for reconnaissance, defense, and firefighting.
- Integrate thermal camera for detection and search-and-rescue.
- Support payload customization (e.g., fire retardant dispensers, beacon droppers).
- Implement real-time thermal and visual feed, GPS navigation, and air quality monitoring.
- Demonstrate practical applications of embedded systems and mechatronics in real-world emergency and defense scenarios.

# üïπ Integrations
## Thermal Camera Visualization to Dashboard
The MLX90640 Thermal Camera is a 32x42 Thermal camera module, which can use I2C to transfer thermal image frames. 
It can support up to 32Hz frame rate. But due to ESP32's low processing power, we will not overload it and keep it to 8Hz. These frames are sent to a websocket server in the base station via a wireless access point link. After being broadcast, the data gets parsed to the dashboard by JavaScript Websocket API and a Custom JavaScript code to generate a Thermal Visualizer to provide better human interaction with the thermal camera data. 

Here is the complete flow chart of the thermal image processing. [View the Full Diagram](https://github.com/TawsifTorabi/AETHER_UAV/blob/main/docs/Flowcharts/ThermalCameraFlowchart.svg)
